- And more features planned.


## Build Instructions

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build and run this app on your own machine:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is required to run React apps, and npm is a package manager that is used to install and manage the dependencies of the app. You can download and install Node.js and npm from the official website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)).
2. Clone the React app repository from GitHub to your local machine.

`git clone https://github.com/MartinMarwad/My-UML-Planner`

`cd My-UML-Planner`

4. Install the dependencies of the app using npm.

`npm install`

This will install all the packages and libraries that are required to run the app.

5. Run the app in development mode.

`npm start`

This will open a browser tab running the app in development mode.
