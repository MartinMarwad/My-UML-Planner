We will analyze a selection of literary texts in relation to the literary movements in which they are conceived, such as modernism, avant-garde, tremendism, realism, experimentalism, etc. This course also examines key social and cultural issues related to literature of this period, such as the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) and the emergence of new identities and subjectivities in democratic Spain. This course will help students develop a solid understanding of 20th and 21st century Spanish literary and culture, and its relevance within a larger European and global context.",
