The seminar will be organized around narratives that address multiple dimensions of diversity including race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, disability, and religion. Too often, guidelines for addressing very complex diversity dynamics are presented as neatly packaged lists of recommendations. However, it is within the stories of the challenges and dilemmas that the complexity of the political, historical, social, and psychological dynamics of diversity are most evident. Students will explore examples of everyday diversity challenges and utilize psychological theories to better understand how the challenges can be shaped by struggles over limited resources, deep historical conflicts between groups, privilege dynamics, intragroup dynamics, organizational cultural norms, and/or other issues.

        "description": "An advanced seminar to consider special topics in developmental psychology with focus on critique of the theoretical and empirical literature, identification of future research pathways, and the potential for application with consideration of ethics and social responsibility. This seminar will explore the phenomenon of adolescent identity development, beginning with Erik Erikson's seminal work on the subject and continuing through contemporary treatments. We will examine development of identity from extended consciousness, a sense of autobiographical self (1-2 years), to a theory of mind (4-5 years), conception of a personal fable (10-14 years), and the emergence of full life stories (17-25 years). Specific issues of focus will include ethnic, social class, and gender role identity development, identity crises and resolutions, and representations of relationships with family, friends, school, and work. Students will write and analyze their own life stories, as well as lead discussions, and prepare a research paper. This is a writing-intensive course.",

Over the last 15-20 years, autism has received an increasing level of attention in both scientific arenas and the popular press. Most recent estimates are that about 1 in 50 children are affected. This seminar will examine issues in the etiology, characteristics and treatment of autism and related developmental disabilities. The seminar will also explore some of the more prominent theories and controversies surrounding these disorders. Much of the seminar will be focused on a behavioral approach to understanding and treating children with autism and significant intellectual challenges. This is a writing-intensive course.",

The course is organized topically. We begin by reading and thinking about the social construction of masculinity and femininity (especially through representations in the media) and how these constructions might contribute to sexual aggression. The bulk of the course is devoted to an examination of psychological processes related to victimization and perpetration. The course concludes with a discussion of several special topics and an examination of rape prevention and education. Special topics may include a focus on juvenile and female offenders, specific risk factors for perpetration, campus sexual assault, pedophilia, child maltreatment, pornography, recidivism rates, offender laws, and victim testimonies.

Narrative often involves a sequence of events, representation of the meaning of those events, and description of the context in which they occurred.  Narrative is the primary means by which we make sense of our experiences and represent ourselves to and develop intimacy with others.  There are important documented differences in narration due to culture, cognition, emotion, age, and gender.  To adequately analyze narration requires expertise in a wide variety of analytic methods and is the overarching goal of this course.",
