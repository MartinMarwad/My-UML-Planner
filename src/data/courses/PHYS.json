To understand the atmospheres of Earth and other planets, stars,  galaxies and the universe, we need to understand the processes which produce electromagnetic radiation, and how radiation interacts with matter and propagates through space. This course describes the basic processes which create and alter such electromagnetic radiation before it's detected here in the Solar System.\nThe course will consist of a combination of lectures, problem sets and class discussion sessions. The  lectures will be expanded from the material in the text  and will include additional material on the astrophysical and planetary context of radiative processes, drawn primarily from the following list of references. The discussion sessions will often be based on recent  problem sets - regular participation of students in class discussions is expected.",
