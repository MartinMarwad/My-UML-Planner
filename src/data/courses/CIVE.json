Drilling methods for soil, gas and ground water sampling; decontamination procedures; and long term monitoring methods are studied. Emphasis in this course is placed on conventional and state-of-the-art in situ methods for geotechnical and environmental site characterization: standard penetration test, vane shear test, dilatometer test, pressuremeter test and cone penetration tests. Modern advances in cone penetrometer technology, instrumented with various sensors (capable of monitoring a wide range of physical and environmental parameters: load, pressure, sound, electrical resistivity, temperature, PH, oxidation reduction potential, chemical contaminants) are playing a major role in site characterization. Principles underlying these methods along with the interpretation of test data will be covered in detail. The course will also look into emerging technologies in the area of site characterization.

In particular, the course examines the fundamental traffic flow characteristics and the flow-speed-density relationship, as well as time and space headway, string stability, traffic flow stability, popular analytical techniques for traffic stream modeling at both microscopic and macroscopic levels, shock wave analysis, and simulation modeling of traffic systems.",
