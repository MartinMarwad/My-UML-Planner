The design process is reviewed from problem statement to final design. The course utilizes casework, in-class exercises, examples of the preparation and use of customer and engineering specifications, and brainstorming techniques to generate feasible solutions to problems, and the process for selecting the most viable solution. Students learn to generate labor and materials budgets for product/project development and methods for the effective oral and written communication of these results. Students complete the course by delivering a comprehensive presentation of the product development effort and results.",
