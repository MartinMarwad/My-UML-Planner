The student will develop a design process that details performance requirements that will translate into topology selection and component requirements. To improve line and load regulation as well as output voltage tolerance, feedback control is introduced using linear regulator. Circuit elements which effect regulation are explored and the improvements in regulation through regulator gain is demonstrated. Protection circuits, regulator efficiency and thermal design are also introduced. The high frequency switching forward conversion topologies are explored, detailing the output filter design and its effect on control and loop stability. Bode plots are used to determine loop stability and selection of the amplifier's break frequencies. PSPICE is used as a tool to plot over all regulator frequency response. The output filter inductor design is studied with respect to core selection, wire size and thermal analysis. The switching regulator efficiency is also studied. Along with the forward converter, the flyback regulators are also introduced both in continuous and discontinuous mode of operation.\nPre-Requisites: 17.350 and 17.365",
