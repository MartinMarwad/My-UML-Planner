Building upon their fundamental knowledge of design, they will explore and test current skills and technology (use of online and digital solutions such as AR, motion and web). Using critical theory and research, they will consider their future roles in the industry and speculate and design for fictional or possible scenarios. The course aims to push students' traditional problem-solving, consider the role of authorship of designed content, and develop conceptual, critical approaches to design.",

The class combines studio work, presentations, visiting lecturers and individual and group critiques, with an emphasis on understanding and embracing risk as a necessary component of a painter's studio practice. Critiques are designed to provide feedback, encourage, challenge, and nurture each student's vision. Assignments are given on an individual basis.
