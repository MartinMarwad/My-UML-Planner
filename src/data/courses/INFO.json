The class focus will be on learning the lessons in what is considered to be the most important Java book written - Effective Java Programming by Joshua Bloch. Aspects of Agile including XP programming, as described in Extreme programming explained by Kent Beck, will be explored and the class will draw on lessons form Kent Beck's book: Test Driven Development as well as additional reading material Students will reinforce the skills learned through a series of short programming assignments with the goal of each being the illumination of a particular concept or best practice, combined with selected readings. A robust online discussion and debate about these topics will be encouraged.
