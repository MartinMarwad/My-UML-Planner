At its core lies the Forbidden City, the largest preserved ancient wooden palatial compound in the world. This course centers first on examining the formal features of the City's layout, spatial planning, decorative schemes, and technical innovations, as well as the integration of the arts within the City. It then investigates how these features supported the profound socio-political symbolism of the empire and its cultural significance both historically and in the 20th century after the establishment of Communist China in 1949. A careful study of the Forbidden City allows us to engage with critical questions about the past and our own position as recipients of such a rare legacy of world civilization.",
