The faculty who teaches this course and their primary discipline of study will rotate through different Arts & Humanities departments as UMass Lowell. Regardless of the primary disciplinary focus for any one section, the course will employ and interdisciplinary approach to prepare students for a study abroad program that will occur during that semester's spring break; offer a vibrant, immersive experience during that time; and then provide activities and assignments after the study abroad experience to allow students to make meaning of that experience. This course will be intended to introduce students to study abroad and provide a framework through which to understand how to connect academic learning and disciplinary expertise in the Arts &  Humanities to the experiential learning that is study abroad. There will be a particular emphasis on placing the study abroad experience in the context of students' academic journeys and identities. Need-based scholarships will be made available to students so that the cost of study abroad will not be a barrier to any RHSA student who wants to participate.",
