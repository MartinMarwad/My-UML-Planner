Techniques for processing N-dimensional images acquired using several different medical image modalities will be studied including basic image visualization, filtering, segmentation and registration. The emphasis will be on engineering methods & techniques rather than a rigorous mathematical investigation of algorithms and theory. Programming will not be required, but homework and projects will require use of an open-source software tool, ImageJ, to perform image processing tasks. [NOTE: Many students in prior semesters have expressed a preference for using MATLAB from Mathworks for image processing. All assignments can be completed using either ImageJ OR MATLAB].",

Many of the analytical skills obtained can be applied across a number of biomedical applications. The syllabus also covers an overview of major biomedical \"Big Data\" areas. Students may implement their final course project using a dataset in any biomedical application area of their choosing, i.e. genomics, medical imaging, health policy informatics, and personal health monitoring. There is no programming pre-requisite for this course. Students must have the willingness and capacity to learn how to apply R Programming.",
