Our goal is to move beyond the \"food, flags, and festivals\" view of global learning and toward meaningful research agendas about the role of higher education in an age of global opportunities and global challenges.",

        "description": "it is well documented that teachers who habitually examine their shared work based on inquiry, observation, analysis of data, dialogue, and experimentation tend to be more effective than those who are not reflective and work in isolation. How do we help all teachers become highly effective: How do we spread reflective practice from isolated pockets to all teachers in a school? The answer lies in the transformation of a school's professional staff from isolated practitioners into a professional learning community. A professional learning community is a work culture in which educators regularly learn with and from each other through collaborative inquiry. This course provides the practical know-how and deep understanding need for educators to introduce and lead collaborative inquiry within their school or district and transform the teaching staff into a professional learning community. Furthermore, this course introduces the idea of collaborative inquiry by transforming participants into a professional learning community during the course. Thus, participants focus collaborative inquiry on their shared practice, read and reflect on selected authors, and develop action plans to help them introduce or advance collaborative inquiry in their own work settings.",

What is the role of technology in science education? Is ability grouping appropriate for learning in science?  Each week we will examine a different issue and share our expertise, as we explore what it means to be a leader in science education.  You will share your own science teaching expertise by developing an article to be submitted to an NSTA publication via a peer review process.
