Economic evaluations of manufacturing operations and projects including essential concepts in accounting, depreciation, time value of money, and the evaluation of investment alternatives are applied for process analysis and design objectives. The impact of management and production costs, product markets, regulatory, environmental and safe production practices, the analysis of corporate annual reports including balance sheets and income statements, and capital and operating costs are all considered in regard to efficient and economic processes.  In addition to lecture materials students are required to complete comprehensive projects.

The course is designed to incorporate recent advances in manufacturing polymer based nanodevices.   Key issues of the implementation and maintenance costs for fabrication will be addressed.  Hands-on laboratory experiments will be performed to complement the lectures with the ultimate goal of designing and building a complete nanodevice at the end of the course.

The course on nanoscale transport phenomena constitutes a bridge between existing fluid and heat transfer courses in multiple disciplines and emerging nanoscale science and engineering concepts to reflect the forefront of nanomanufacturing. The course is designed to incorporate recent advances in manufacturing polymer-based nanodevices. Key issues of the implementation and maintenance costs for fabrication will be addressed. Hands-on laboratory experiments will be performed to complement the lectures with the ultimate goal of designing and building a complete nanodevice at the end of the course. The course will prepare graduates for employment focused on designing and manufacturing nano/microfluidic systems, lab-on-a-chip devices, electronics devices, medical devices, and other emerging technologies.",
