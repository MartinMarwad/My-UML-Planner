Through the creation of a digital portfolio, this course validates our major students' linguistic hands-on experience through study abroad or community-based practicum experience and it establishes consistency in our major curriculum by ensuring that all our majors are getting a high-quality linguistic experience abroad or at home. This course is conducted in the target language in which the student majors. For those students majoring in French/Spanish and Italian/Spanish options, the student chooses the target language in which the coursework is completed.",
